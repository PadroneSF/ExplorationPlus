Files making up this mod are currently loaded directly into the ContractPacks directory. The purpose of update is to create a ContractPacks\ExplorationPlus directory to contain the mod files.

INSTALLATION takes two steps:

1) REMOVE PRIOR version of ExplorationPlus!  CKAN: easy.  Manual install: look inside \GameData\ContractPacks and find every file that starts with "ExplorationPlus" and delete them.  There are ten of them.

2) Install as usual.  PLEASE NOTE:  This mod has the complete path of \GameData\ContractPacks\ExplorationPlus.  Do not place this file structure inside your current \GameData!  Copy it ON TOP OF the existing \GameData.  You will be asked if you want to merge directories.  This is safe to do as long as you are putting it in the right directory.  This mod's \GameData goes on TOP of the \GameData on your drive.  If you are asked to overwrite anything, STOP!  Cancel.  Review instructions and try again.

Really, using CKAN takes all the worry out of installing mods.  It even takes care of installing any missing required mods.
