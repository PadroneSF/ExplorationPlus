Files making up this mod are currently loaded directly into the ContractPacks directory. 

The purpose of this fork is to offer up a PR to create a ContractPacks\ExplorationPlus directory to contain the mod files.

Temporary Fork until changes are adopted by severedsolo (or not).

INSTALLATION: REMOVE PRIOR version of ExplorationPlus!  CKAN: easy.  Manual install: look inside \GameData\ContractPacks and find every file that starts with "ExplorationPlus" and delete them.  There are ten of them.

Then install as usual.  PLEASE NOTE:  This mod has the complete path of \GameData\ContractPacks\ExplorationPlus.  Do not place this file structure inside your current \GameData!  Copy it ON TOP OF the existing \GameData.  You will be asked if you want to overwrite existing files.  This is safe to do as long as you are putting it in the right directory.  This mod's \GameData goes on TOP of the \GameData on your drive.

Really, using CKAN takes all the worry out of installing mods.  It even takes care of installing any missing required mods.
